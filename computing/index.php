                My main interests in computing lie in computer networking, and UNIX Systems Administration.
                In particular, I have a deep interest in FreeBSD, although I do also have relatively extensive
                knowledge of both Debian and CentOS.

                Whilst I would not regard myself as a software developer, I do have a github account containing
                several projects that I have open-sourced. It can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/pricetx/">here</a>.
