                My passion for aviation can be attributed largely to my father. I spent a large part of
                my childhood at air shows, air museums and planespotting. Eventually, at the age of 16,
                I had a chance to fly for myself. Through the RAF's Air Cadet program I was able to fly
                a Vigilant T1 powered glider. From that moment I was hooked. Sadly, due to other commitments
                I could not continue to train with the RAF, but decided to begin saving for private lessons.

                In 2015 I finally took the plunge and began taking lessons at Elstree aerodrome in Hertfordshire.
                I am currently working towards an EASA PART-FCL, which is the Europe-wide Private Pilot's License. 
                I currently take lessons fairly infrequently as my immediate focus is on studying for and passing 
                the nine theory exams required to take my checkride. I hope to be able to attain my license by late 2017.
